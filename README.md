# Face Recognition Based Attendance System by Anika Goel
## About
In this Attendance System the attendance for students is marked using Face verification. The Faculty has the permission to take Attendance, add a student, modify student details. The Faculty can also search for attendance of a student using Multiparameter Search, by specifying the student ID, date of attendance, period of Attendance.<br>
The credentials for the Faculty are provided by the superuser who has access to the whole database. Only the superuser can update the attendance of a student.<br>
**Django** web framework was used for the development of the whole web app. **OpenCv and face_recognition API's** were used for the development of Face Recognizer. The Face Recognizer can detect multiple faces at a time and mark their attendance into Database.<br>
For this project, I have learnt techstack like Opencv and used Face recognition API's and Django for python web framework.
